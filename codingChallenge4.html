      <h1>CODING CHALLENGE 4 </h1>
<p>
Let's remember the first coding challenge where Max and Tony compared their BMIs. <br>
Let's now implement the same functionality with objects and methods. <br>
1.) For each of them, create an object with properties for their full name, mass and height.<br>
2.)Then, add a method to each object to calculate the BMI. Save the BMI to the object and also return it from the method. <br>
3.) In the end, log to the console who has the highest BMI, together with the full name and respective BMI. <br>
 Don't foret they might have the same BMI <br> <br>

Remember: BMI = mass / height^2 =  mass / (height * height). (mass in kg and height in meter)
