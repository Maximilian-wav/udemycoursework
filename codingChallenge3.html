        <h1>Code Challenge #3 - tip calculator</h1>
        <p> John and his family went on a holiday and went to 3 different restaurants.
 The bills were $124, $48, and $268.
<br> <br>
 To tip the waiter a fair amount, John created a single tip calculator (as a function).
 He likes to tip 20% of the bill when the bill is less than %50, 15% when the bill is between $50 and $200.
 Abd 10% if the bill is more than $200.
<br><br>
 In the End, John would like to have 2 arrays:
 <br>
 1.) Containing all three tips ( one for each bill)
 <br>
 2.)Containing all thee final paid amounts ( bill + tip). </p>
